# Flutter Smart Home Animated App

I've created a step-by-step video tutorial to guide you through the process of building a Animated Smart Home App using Flutter. **[Watch it on YouTube](https://youtu.be/7l-0x1Y7d1M)**

Welcome to the 'Animated Smart Home App'. In this video, we'll begin by showing you how to create a parallax effect in Flutter. We'll be focusing on using the implicit widget for most animations. Plus, you'll see how we use explicit animation widgets and custom transitions when moving from one page to another. Enjoy!
